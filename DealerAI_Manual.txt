######################################## DEALER AI ########################################

######## AI Levels ########
# Level 1: AI decides purely on odds. Does not predict future turns.
# Level 2: AI calculates based on odds, and uses player's and its own previous decisions to make guesses on its own next move.

######## HOW THE AI WORKS ########
# Main.py calls for Dealer's turn.
# Turn() receieves Main.py's call.
# If AILevel = 1, Turn() analyses chances and returns its decision.
# If AILevel = 2, Turn() analyses chances and returns its decision to ReturnDecision() (either "Live" or "Blank").
# ReturnDecision() receieves Turn()'s call.
# ReturnDecision() calls Track() to update the list of moves made (see Track() function for details)
# ReturnDecision() returns Turn()'s call to Analyse().
# Analyse() recieves ReturnDecision()'s call.
# Analyse() analyses the past moves kept updated by Track() (see Analyse() function for details).
# Analyse() returns the results of the analysis to ConfirmAnalysis().
# ConfirmAnalysis() recieves Analyse()'s call.
# ConfirmAnalysis() checks the value of Analyse()'s call (the results of the analysis) to ensure that it is within the range laid out by the variables "AnalysisReturnMin" and "AnalysisReturnMax".
# ConfirmAnalysis() compares the value of Analyse()'s call (the results of the analysis) to see whether it is bigger than or equal to the variable "BlankChance" in the event that Turn() returned "Live", or whether it is bigger than or equal to the variable "LiveChance" in the event that Turn() returned "Blank".
# If ConfirmAnalysis() comfirms either of these statements are true, ConfirmAnalysis() will return the decision equal to Turn()'s return. Otherwise, return the opposite decision and update Track().
# ConfirmAnalysis() returns its decision to Main.py.
# Main.py updates LogicManager of Dealer's decision.
# LogicManager updates the game.
